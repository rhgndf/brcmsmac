# Existing brcmsmac bugs

Pre-existing defects found while adding BCM43227 support. They are not
fixed by this series, which only adds what the new device needs. Line
numbers refer to the standalone import, `050991b`.

## TX FIFO size table bounds check is off by one and only warns

`brcms_b_attach()`, `brcmsmac/main.c:4529-4535`:

```c
WARN_ON(wlc_hw->corerev < XMTFIFOTBL_STARTREV ||
	(wlc_hw->corerev - XMTFIFOTBL_STARTREV) >
		ARRAY_SIZE(xmtfifo_sz));
wlc_hw->xmtfifo_sz =
    xmtfifo_sz[(wlc_hw->corerev - XMTFIFOTBL_STARTREV)];
WARN_ON(!wlc_hw->xmtfifo_sz[0]);
```

- The upper bound uses `>` instead of `>=`, so a core revision with
  `corerev - XMTFIFOTBL_STARTREV == ARRAY_SIZE(xmtfifo_sz)` is not
  flagged.
- Both checks only warn. Attach continues, indexes past the end of
  `xmtfifo_sz[]` for an out-of-range revision, and programs a zero-sized
  partition for an all-zero row.

Not reachable with the shipped configuration: the BCMA match table,
`brcms_coreid_table[]`, only binds core revisions 17, 23 and 24 (and 30
after this series), and each has a non-zero row. It only matters when a
revision is bound without its row.

**Fix:** use `>=`, and fail the attach (`err = 20; goto fail;`) instead
of warning, for both the range and the zero-row check.

## The per-second background noise sample costs a beacon and is never used

`wlc_phy_watchdog()`, `brcmsmac/phy/phy_cmn.c:2252-2256`, requests a
background noise sample every second (`MCMD_BG_NOISE` in `maccommand`).
On the `MI_BG_NOISE` interrupt, `wlc_phy_noise_sample_intr()`
(`brcmsmac/main.c:7725-7726`, `phy_cmn.c:1965`) stores the result in
`phy_noise_window[]` or `nphy_noise_win[]` through `wlc_phy_noise_cb()`
(`phy_cmn.c:1903`). Nothing reads either array, and brcmsmac does not
report noise to mac80211 (no `get_survey`).

The sample is not free. On a BCM43227 (firmware 832.127) with power
save off, the station received 87-89 of the AP's ~98 beacons in 10 s
with the sample, and 97-98 without it (4 alternating rounds, beacon
interval 100 TU): each request costs about one beacon. In power save
the microcode takes the sample when it next wakes up, before the TBTT
of a beacon it listens for, and misses that beacon. The power save
commit stops requesting the sample while the microcode sleeps, because
power save depends on those beacons; the cost while awake remains.

Reachable on every N-PHY and LCN-PHY device whenever the interface is
up.

**Fix:** stop requesting the sample, or report its result to mac80211
through `get_survey` so that it is used.
